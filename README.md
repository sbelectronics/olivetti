# Scott's Olivetti M20 Repository

https://www.smbaker.com/

This repository contains a number of resources that I have put together
for the Olivetti M20 computer. This includes both things I have written myself
as well as things I have found and recompiled. May also include hardware I
developed, that sort of things.

Some hilights:

* Zork for the Olivetti M20 PCOS. Yes, play Zork 1 natively in PCOS.

* Xmodem and Ymodem file transfer utilizies. From source code in C, for reliable transfer to the M20.

* LBForth (a variant of Jonesforth) ported to M20 PCOS. In case you want to program in Forth

New Boards:

* dualser: Dual Serial Port Board

* sound: AY-3-8910 Sound Card

* speech: SP0256A-AL2 Speech Synthesizer

* vdip: VDIP, Pi-Emulated-VDIP, and Compactflash Hard Drive. The CompactFlash requires a
  special BIOS and a special image. Ask Salvatore Paxia for details.
