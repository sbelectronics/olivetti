# Scott's Olivetti M20 Repository

https://www.smbaker.com/

This repository contains a number of resources that I have put together
for the Olivetti M20 computer. This includes both things I have written myself
as well as things I have found and recompiled. May also include hardware I
developed, that sort of things.

Some hilights:

* Zork for the Olivetti M20 PCOS. Yes, play Zork 1 natively in PCOS.

* Xmodem and Ymodem file transfer utilizies. From source code in C, for reliable transfer to the M20.

* LBForth (a variant of Jonesforth) ported to M20 PCOS. In case you want to program in Forth
