Find my released images in the `release` directory. I
only put up images for the disks that I've created myself. For
stock images check the groessler ftp site.

Two copies of each image are present.

The -unpadded images use 128 byte sectors on the first track. I
use them with my gotek.

The -padded images use 256 byte sectors on the first track. I
use them with my greaseweazle.

I do not publish the Zork image because I do not have thr rights
to redistribute ZORK1.DAT, ZORK2.DAY, or ZORK3.DAT. You can get
these files from any CP/M or MSDOS ZORK disk. You can possibly
also find the published olivetti Zork image on other places on
the internet.
