Zork for Olivetti M20 PCOS.            

To play Zork 1, a simple "olizork" command will do.

To play Zork 3, use "olizork zork3.dat".

Zork 2 wouldn't fit the way I'm loading things into memory.
The story is just a little too long, and I'm assuming I can
fit all of himem into a single 64K chunk. Oh well.

If you are bulding these disks, you may obtain zork1.dat and
zork2.dat from a CP/M, MSDOS, or other distribution of Zork
that you already own. I do not redistribute the data files.
Make sure to give them lower case filenames.
